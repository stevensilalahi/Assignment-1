1.	Roll A Ball: In roll a ball, I basically followed the tutorial from the Unity website. In the game we have this sphere sitting in the play area. We control the sphere movement using the directional keypad on the keyboard. In the play area there are these floating and spinning cubes that the player are supposed to collect. Once they collect them all, they win!

Instructions:
- Use the left right up and down arrows on the keyboard to move the ball. 
- Collect the floating diamonds in the play area until they ran out to win the game.
- Restart the game to try again 

2.	Escape Home: The concept of Escape Home is pretty similar to Roll A Ball. Except it is obvious that the scene has a little bit more story to it. The player in this game takes in the form of an egg, with the danger of the world. The egg must find its way to roll back to the chicken coop to stay safe. The game consists of a simple obstacle course with distorted paths and barrels that works as a barricade to keep the egg from returning home. Once the egg is able to make it back to the chicken coop or so-called “home”, the player wins the game. 

Instructions:
- Use the left right up and down arrows on the keyboard to move the ball. 
- Avoid the barrel obstacles and avoid falling in the water.
- Win the game by collecting the floating yellow object at the end of the path. 
- Restart the game to try again
